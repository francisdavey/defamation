      The plaintiff was a member of a golf club of which the two
      defendants were the proprietors and the female defendant also the
      secretary. One of the rules of the club provided that <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">no
      notice or placard shall be posted in the club premises without the
      consent of the secretary.</span>”</span> Certain automatic gambling
      machines had been kept by the defendants on the club premises for
      the use of the members of the club. Some one gave information to
      the police, with the result that the machines were removed from
      the club premises. On the following day some one put up on the
      wall of the club a typewritten paper containing the following
      verse:-
    </p><div class="literallayout"><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">For many years upon this spot<br>
You heard the sound of a merry bell<br>
Those who were rash and those who were not<br>
Lost and made a spot of cash<br>
But he who gave the game away<br>
May he byrnn in hell and rue the day.</span>”</span></p></div><p>
      The word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">byrnn</span>”</span> was blacked out in the original and
      the word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">burn</span>”</span> substituted for it. The plaintiff
      brought a libel action against the two defendants alleging that
      they had published the words in the notice of and concerning him
      to the members of the club. He alleged that the words meant that
      he had reported to the police the existence of the machines upon
      the club premises and that he had been guilty of underhand
      disloyalty to the members of the club.
    </p><p>
      Held: (1) not libellous because a law-abiding member of society
      would think Mr Byrne had acted properly; (2) there was sufficient
      evidence of publication because the defendants had not removed the
      note despite being aware of it.

      H. &amp; Sons were in the habit of receiving, in payment from
      their customers, cheques on various branches of a bank, which the
      bank cashed for the convenience of H. &amp; Sons at a particular
      branch. Having had a squabble with the manager of that branch H.
      &amp; Sons sent a printed circular to a large number of their
      customers (who knew nothing of the squabble)—<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">H. &amp; Sons
      hereby give notice that they will not receive in payment cheques
      drawn on any of the branches of the</span>”</span> bank. The circular
      became known to other persons; there was a run on the bank and
      loss inflicted. The bank having brought an action against H. &amp;
      Sons for libel, with an innuendo that the circular imputed
      insolvency.
    </p><p>
      Held: the natural meaning of the words was not libellous.

      Mr Artemus Jones, a barrister in practice, had been at one time on
      the staff of the Sunday Chronicle , a newspaper owned and
      published by the appellants, and contributed articles signed by
      himself to some of the appellants’ publications. The appellants
      published in the Sunday Chronicle an article a part of which ran
      thus;
    </p><p>
      ``<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Upon the terrace marches the world, attracted by the
      motor races—a world immensely pleased with itself, and minded to
      draw a wealth of inspiration—and, incidentally, of golden
      cocktails—from any scheme to speed the passing hour. …
      <span class="quote">‘<span class="quote">Whist! there is Artemus Jones with a woman who is not his
      wife, who must be, you know—the other thing!</span>’</span> whispers a
      fair neighbour of mine excitedly into her bosom friend’s ear.
      Really, is it not surprising how certain of our fellow-countrymen
      behave when they come abroad? Who would suppose, by his goings on,
      that he was a churchwarden at Peckham? No one, indeed, would
      assume that Jones in the atmosphere of London would take on so
      austere a job as the duties of a churchwarden. Here, in the
      atmosphere of Dieppe, on the French side of the Channel, he is the
      life and soul of a gay little band that haunts the Casino and
      turns night into day, besides betraying a most unholy delight in
      the society of female butterflies.</span>”</span>
    </p><p>
      Artemus Jones complained and the newspaper printed the following
      apology:
    </p><p>
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">It seems hardly necessary for us to state that the
      imaginary Mr. Artemus Jones referred to in our article was not Mr.
      Thomas Artemus Jones, barrister, but, as he has complained to us,
      we gladly publish this paragraph in order to remove any possible
      misunderstanding and to satisfy Mr. Thomas Artemus Jones we had no
      intention whatsoever of referring to him.</span>”</span>
    </p><p>
      Note that: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">apart from the name used, none of the details
      with regard to the imaginary personage described in the libel were
      applicable to the plaintiff, inasmuch as he is not a married man,
      nor a churchwarden, nor a resident of Peckham; nor was he either a
      frequenter of Dieppe or there at the time when the scene described
      in the alleged libel took place.</span>”</span>
    </p><p>
      Held: for the plaintiff.
    </p><p>
      Chase v News Group Newspapers
    </p><p>
      On the front page of the newspaper for June 22 there was a large
      headline <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Nurse is probed over 18 deaths: World
      Exclusive</span>”</span>. The article said that she was suspected of
      overdosing terminally ill <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">youngsters</span>”</span> with
      painkillers. It identified the children concerned as nine boys and
      nine girls, aged between eight weeks and 17 years.
    </p><p>
      Held: The words were incapable of meaning merely <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">reasonable
      grounds to investigate</span>”</span>. In order to justify a publication
      to the effect that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that
      the claimant was guilty of an offence, a defendant had to
      establish that there were objectively reasonable grounds for such
      suspicion. The defendant could not establish this and would
      therefore fail.
