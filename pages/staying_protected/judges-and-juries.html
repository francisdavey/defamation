    All the following material is, to some extent, obsolete. Juries will
    be very unlikely to be used for defamation claimes, in line with
    almost all other civil claims. But the existence of juries until
    very recently has had its mark on the law of defamation, so I have
    included below my previous notes on judges and juries.
  </p><p>
    Fox’s Libel Act reformed the criminal procedure for libel so that
    trial was always before a jury. That rule has been adapted to civil
    proceedings so that a defamation claim is almost always heard in a
    trial by jury. This is now unusual because in England and Wales we
    have largely dropped the use of juries for civil claims except for a
    small number of rather special causes of action (such as claims
    against the Police for false imprisonment). Because trial is usually
    by jury it is important to understand the different roles judges and
    juries have.

    Most lawyers understand the law/fact division but it is not at all
    plain to the lay person. For example whether a statement
    <span class="strong"><strong>is</strong></span> defamatory is obviously a
    question of fact (which a jury would decide) but whether it is the
    kind of statement that <span class="strong"><strong>could be</strong></span>
    defamatory is a legal question (which a judge would decide).
  </p><p>
    This has several consequences:
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
        The judge can make decisions about what meanings a statement
        could have and whether they could be defamatory at any stage
        prior to the trial as well as at the trial. A common tactic to
        use at an early stage is to try to knock out meanings or indeed
        the whole case by an application for
        <span class="strong"><strong>summary judgment</strong></span> or
        <span class="strong"><strong>striking out</strong></span>.
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        The case law has to be read with care because the decisions are
        usually about what <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be defamatory not
        what <span class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> defamatory. The decision of a jury
        is neither here nor there.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
    This means that in a defamation claim the following processes could
    occur.
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
        C pleads that the S means M
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        The judge considers:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem"><p>
            could S mean M? (is M a meaning S is capable of bearing)
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            is M capable of being defamatory?
          </p></li></ol></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
        The jury considers:
      </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem"><p>
            what does S mean?
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            is <span class="strong"><strong>that</strong></span> meaning
            defamatory?
