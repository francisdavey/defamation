    There are several, overlapping, defences available to a web host
    that may act as a defence against a claim for libel. They are:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
        Innocent dissemination
      </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

      Under section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996, a defendant is not
      liable for a statement if they:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          were not the author, editor or publisher
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          took reasonable care in respect of publication
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          did not know and had no reason to know that D caused or
          contributed to the publication of a defamatory statement
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Author</span>”</span>, straightforwardly means the person who
      originated the statement.
    </p><p>
      An <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">editor</span>”</span> is someone who has editorial or
      equivalent responsibility for the content of the statement or the
      decision to publish it. This is likely to include an activity such
      as moderating comments pre-publication, but I do not think it
      would include moderating comments in response to complaints (eg of
      abuse).
    </p><p>
      The word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">publisher</span>”</span>, in the context of the 1996 Act
      (and section 10 of the Defamation Act 2013, see below) does not
      mean simply someone who publishes (in the common law sense) a
      statement. It means a person whose business is issuing material to
      the public (or a section of the public) and who issues material
      containing the statement in the course of that business.
    </p><p>
      The key word here is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">issue</span>”</span>. For example, a
      bookseller is not a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">publisher</span>”</span> for the purposes of
      this definition because they merely distribute books, rather than
      issuing them to the public.
    </p><p>
      In <span class="emphasis"><em>McGrath v Dawkins</em></span>
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2012/B3.html" target="_top">[2012]
      EWHC B3</a>, the court rules that Amazon was not a
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">commercial publisher</span>”</span> of its website, because it the
      website was not its main source of revenue which comes from
      selling books etc. That seems to me to be rather generous to
      Amazon. The court also held that, despite the fact that Amazon did
      look at reviews and comments in response to complaints, it was not
      an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">editor</span>”</span>.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-10-defamation-act-2013"></a>Section 10, Defamation Act 2013</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Like section 1 of the 1996 Act, Section 10 of the 2013 Act is a
      generic defence to defamation that is not restricted to internet
      publication, but it will be generally useful for internet
      publishers.
    </p><p>
      Where a claim is for defamation is brought against someone who is
      not the author, editor or publisher (in the sense of the 1996 Act
      discussed above), the court has no jurisdiction to hear it unless
      the court is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable for
      an action to be brought against the author, editor or publisher.
    </p><p>
      In practice this means that a claimant suing someone who was not
      an author, editor or publisher, would almost certainly have to
      produce evidence that it was <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">not reasonably
      practicable</span>”</span> to sue that actual author etc. There is, as
      yet, no case law on what this means, so there are several points
      that are not clear.
    </p><p>
      In the first place, it is possible to sue someone without knowing
      their identity. In <span class="emphasis"><em>Bloomsbury Publishing Group v News
      Group Newspapers</em></span><a href="#ftn.idp11376912" class="footnote" name="idp11376912"><sup class="footnote">[15]</sup></a> the court allowed a claim to proceed where instead of
      naming the defendants, they were described as:
    </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
        the person or persons who have offered the publishers of the
        Sun, the Daily Mail, and the Daily Mirror newspapers a copy of
        the book ’Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix’ by
        JKRowling or any part thereof and the person or persons who has
        or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any
        part thereof without the consent of the claimants.
      </p></blockquote></div><p>
      This approach has been used on a number of other occasions and has
      been endorsed by the Supreme Court.<a href="#ftn.idp11380768" class="footnote" name="idp11380768"><sup class="footnote">[16]</sup></a> Anonymity does not make <span class="emphasis"><em>starting</em></span>
      a claim very much more difficult.
    </p><p>
      Serving the claim on the defendant might require a little more
      effort than usual. If it is clear that they will read something
      (eg twitter, facebook, a blog post) then a court might permit
      service via tweet or post. If their email address is available,
      then service by email could be used. A web host could be required
      to supply that email address by a Norwich Pharmacal Order.
    </p><p>
      It is quite possible that section 10 requires not that
      <span class="emphasis"><em>starting</em></span> a claim be reasonably practicable,
      but the claim itself. Some lawyers have suggested that suing
      someone in the United States, where English defamation judgments
      are hard to enforce, might not be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">reasonably
      practicable</span>”</span> because the claim itself would be pointless.
      This is not the literal meaning of section 10, but it is entirely
      possible that the courts will decide to interpret it that way.
    </p><p>
      What this means is that identity is not the end of the story. But
      if you are threatened over defamatory postings where you are not
      the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">author, editor or publisher</span>”</span> and the real author
      etc is easily identifiable, you have a good argument that you
      cannot be sued.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="section-5-defamation-act-2013"></a>Section 5, Defamation Act 2013</h3></div></div></div><p>
      This is a defence available to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">operators of
      websites</span>”</span> for statements posted on their website, provided
      they did not post the statement themselves – and presumably where
      it was posted on the their behalf either. A claimant may be able
      to defeat the defence, but only if they are able to prove three
      things:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          it was not possible for them to identify the person who posted
          the statement
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          they gave a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">notice of complaint</span>”</span> to the operator
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          the operator failed to respond to the notice correctly
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Section 5 goes on to say that it is only possible to
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">identify</span>”</span> the poster if the claimant has sufficient
      information to bring proceedings against them. See my remarks on
      section 10 for difficulties with that condition.
    </p><p>
      The idea of section 5 is to try to put the claimant and the poster
      of the statement in direct contact and leave the website operator
      out of the dispute. Roughly speaking, having received a complaint,
      if the operator is unable to contact the poster, or the poster
      does not respond with a plausible name and address, or if they ask
      for the statement to be taken down, then the operator must take
      the statement down, otherwise the operator need only pass on the
      poster’s contact details and may then leave the statement up
      without worrying about it.
    </p><p>
      In practice, section 5 is quite involved. Hopefully the following
      summary will help.
    </p><p>
      The process starts when someone (the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">complainant</span>”</span>)
      complains to the operator that a statement on their website is
      defamatory of the complainant. In order to constitute a proper
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">notice of complaint</span>”</span> the complainant must send a
      notice containing all the following information:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          their name and electronic mail address
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          the statement
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              the meaning attributed to it
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              an explanation of why it is defamatory
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              where it may be found on the website
            </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          which aspects of the statement the complainant believes are:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              factually inaccurate; or
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              opinions not supported by fact
            </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          a confirmation that the complainant does not have sufficient
          information
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          whether the complainant consents to the operator providing the
          poster wit
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Some of this is potentially useful. In my experience many
      complaints of defamation do not make clear what exactly is wrong
      with a statement, or in some cases fail to identity a specific
      statement at all. Forcing the complainant to set this out in a
      notice of complaint is useful.
    </p><p>
      An oddity about the notice is that the complainant has to confirm
      that they do not have sufficient information to bring proceedings,
      but the test in section 5 is that it is not possible for them to
      identify the poster. As discussed under the section 10 offence
      above, these are really quite different situations.
    </p><p>
      Even if the complainant fails to set out all the information they
      are supposed to, the operator must still respond within 48 hours
      of receiving the notice from the complainant, informing the
      complainant that:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          the notice does not comply with the requirements set out in
          section 5(6)(a) to (c) of the Act and regulation 2; and
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          what those requirements are
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Another oddity here is that the operator does not have to say what
      is wrong with the notice. As far as I can tell, a standard form
      response to any defective notice of complaint is fine. In practice
      it would almost certainly be better to tell the complainant where
      you think they have gone wrong.
    </p><p>
      If a valid notice of complaint is received, the next step seems to
      be designed to check whether the poster is a repeat offender. If
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          that complainant has sent two or more previous notices of
          complaint about a statement that:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              was posted on the same website
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              by the same person
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              and conveys the same or substantially the same imputation
              as each of the previous notices
            </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          on each of those occasions the statement was removed from the
          website in accordance with the regulations (which would not be
          the case if the poster had formally resisted removal, or the
          statement was removed for some other reason)
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          the complainant informs the operator, at the same time as
          sending the notice of complaint (you would expect, in the same
          letter or email) that the complainant has sent a notice of
          complaint to the operator on two or more previous occasions in
          relation to the statement
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      If all these conditions are met, the operator must remove the
      statement within 48 hours of receiving the notice of complaint and
      inform the complainant that they have done so.
    </p><p>
      Normally, a notice of complaint will not relate to earlier
      complaints. In that case, the operator must decide whether they
      are able to contact the poster personally. If they are not, then
      they must, within 48 hours of receiving the notice, remove the
      statement and send an acknowledgement to the complainant informing
      them that they have removed the statement.
    </p><p>
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Able to contact</span>”</span> means able to contact
      <span class="strong"><strong>electronically</strong></span>. If the poster
      is sitting in the same office as the operator, but the operator
      does not have an email address etc for them, then they are not
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">able to contact</span>”</span> them and must remove the statement.
    </p><p>
      If the operator is able to contact the poster, they must then,
      within 48 hours, send an acknowledgement to the complainant
      informing them that the operator is contacting the poster and also
      send the poster:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          a copy of the notice of complaint (with the complainant’s name
          and address removed if they have not consented to the supply
          of that information to the poster)
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          notification that the statement may be removed unless:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              the operator receives a response from the poster by
              midnight on the 5th day after the day on which the
              notification was sent; and
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              the poster’s response contains:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: square; "><li class="listitem"><p>
                  the poster’s full name
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                  the postal address of the poster’s home or business
                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                  whether the poster consents to the operator providing
                  the previous two items of information to the
                  complainant
                </p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          notification that the poster’s name and address will not be
          released to the complainant unless the poster consents or the
          operator is ordered to do so by a court
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      If, by midnight on the 5th day, the poster has not responded, or
      if they have responded but their response failed to contain the
      requirement information and indications as to whether the the
      poster consents to its release, of if they have responded
      correctly and asked for the statement to be removed, the operator
      must, within 48 hours, remove the statement from the website and
      send a notice to the complainant indicating that they have done
      so.
    </p><p>
      If a reasonable operator would consider the name or postal address
      in the poster’s response to be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">obviously false</span>”</span>,
      then the poster’s response is to be treated as if it did not
      contain that information.
    </p><p>
      If the poster responds in time, with all the required information,
      and states that they wish the statement to remain, then the
      operator does not have to remove it. However they must, within 48
      hours, inform the complainant that the poster does not wish the
      statement to be removed and that it has not been removed. If the
      poster consented to their name or address being provided to the
      complainant, that must be supplied at the same time. If the poster
      did not consent, the complainant must be notified in writing of
      that fact.

      directive</a> creates a general defence for those who are only
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hosting</span>”</span> information, against almost all forms of
      liability for that information including defamation, but also
      other things such as copyright. The main exception is liability
      under the data protection directive (and hence the Data Protection
      Act 1998).
    </p><p>
      The defence applies to someone hosting information if:

          they are an Information Society Service

      Furthermore a hosting provider has no obligation to search out
      potential libels. For example in <span class="emphasis"><em>Metropolitan

      to prevent future defamatory snippets appearing as a result of any
      search (although this decision would probably have been reached
      even without the benefit of the directive).

      Practical examples that might come up with a site like

      The House of Lords held in Derbyshire County Council v Times
      Newspapers that an organ of local or central government may not
      sue for defamation. This probably applies to other public bodies,
      but how far the line is drawn is unclear. Happily the principle
      applies to political parties as well<a href="#ftn.idp11457248" class="footnote" name="idp11457248"><sup class="footnote">[20]</sup></a> but we do not have the wonderful US rule which makes
      it very difficult for public figures to sue.

      Something defamatory of a council may easily imply that someone in
      the council is defamed too. The fact that someone is a public
      servant may sue if they are defamed even if the defamation is
      linked to their carrying out public functions.<a href="#ftn.idp11458848" class="footnote" name="idp11458848"><sup class="footnote">[21]</sup></a>

      Must be to someone other than the claimant and/or defendant (so
      insulting someone in an email sent only to them is not
      defamatory). Two authorities are relevant to us:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Byrne v Deane - allowing something to remain that you could
          remove may constitute publication
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Godfrey v Demon Internet - for example leaving defamatory
          posts you have been informed about on a USENET server would
          constitute publication.

        Does linking to material constitute publication? There is (as
        yet) no direct authority on this point in English law. Some old
        cases could give us a clue:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            Hird v Wood - the defendant sat on a stool near a placard
            which had been put up on the roadway containing defamatory
            matter. He remained there for a long time smoking a pipe and
            he continually pointed at the placard with his finger and
            thereby attracted to it the attention of all who passed by.
            HELD: publication.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Smith v Wood - the defendant has a copy of a libellous
            caricature print. A witness heard that the defendant had a
            copy, went to visit him and asked to see it. The defendant
            produced it to him and pointed out the figure of the
            plaintiff. HELD: no sufficient evidence of publication.
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            Lawrence v Newberry - letter published in a newspaper
            referred its readers to a speech in the House of Lords which
            was alleged to contain defamatory matter. HELD: the letter
            published the defamatory matter in the speech.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        It is hard to draw any firm conclusions. It seems to me that a
        link to something defamatory with text saying <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">here is a
        defamation</span>”</span> would certainly be publication.
