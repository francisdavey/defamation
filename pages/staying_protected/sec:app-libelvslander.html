    Recall that originally libel was for writing and slander for spoken
    forms of defamation. Over time libel has absorbed almost any form of
    non-spoken defamation, including anything broadcast and anything
    recorded in permanent form.
  </p><p>
    Why does this matter? Libel has a historical origin as a part of the
    criminal process and a means by which the state could prevent
    scurrilous printed material. As a result libel is one of the very
    small number of causes of action where there was no need to prove
    damage of any kind.
  </p><p>
    Slander, on the other hand, has a different background. In most
    cases for there to be a valid claim for slander, actual damage would
    have to be proved. There were some exceptions to this for
    particularly serious slanders, such as a a statement that a woman
    was unchaste.<a href="#ftn.idp11487696" class="footnote" name="idp11487696"><sup class="footnote">[12]</sup></a>
  </p><p>
    Although it may feel like a slander, everything written on the web
    will be treated as a libel. Thus whether or not there was damage is
    immaterial.
  </p><p>
    Since the Defamation Act 2013 has imposed a requirement of
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">serious harm</span>”</span><a href="#ftn.idp11491088" class="footnote" name="idp11491088"><sup class="footnote">[13]</sup></a> it seems to me that this distinction is likely to be
    very obscure. Claims for slander are fairly rare. The fact that a
    defamatory statement was slander rather than libel would matter only
    where there had as yet been no damage to the claimant’s reputation
    but where serious harm was likely to be caused.
