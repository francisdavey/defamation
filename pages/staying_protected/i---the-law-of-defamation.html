        These notes will start with an explanation of what is and is not
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">defamatory</span>”</span>, but first something needs to be got
        out of the way. Sometimes people use the term
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">defamatory</span>”</span> only for statements that are untrue.
        Indeed there can be quite heated arguments about it. As will, I
        hope, be clear, it is better to think of
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">defamatory</span>”</span> as referring to certain kinds of
        statements that hurt someone’s reputation even if they might be
        quite true.
      </p><p>
        In other words the statement:
      </p><p>
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Lord Archer is a convicted criminal</span>”</span>
      </p><p>
        is defamatory (but true).
      </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="libel-and-slander"></a>libel and slander</h4></div></div></div><p>
        Defamation is an umbrella term for two distinct kinds of claim
        (technically known as <span class="strong"><strong>causes of
        action</strong></span>), which are:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="strong"><strong>libel</strong></span> - written,
            broadcast or performed statements
          </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
            <span class="strong"><strong>slander</strong></span> - spoken (or
            otherwise impermanent) statements
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Since defamatory material published on websites will be libel,
        the practical differences between libel and slander are left to
        Appendix [sec:applibelvslander].

      Defamation is part of an area of law known as the ``law of
      <span class="strong"><strong>tort</strong></span>” from which we derive two
      eye-watering words: <span class="strong"><strong>tortious</strong></span>
      and <span class="strong"><strong>tortfeasor</strong></span>. The following
      is an outline of how a defamation (and indeed most tort claims) is
      carried out. I am simplifying by omitting applications and
      injunctions which can happen <span class="emphasis"><em>at any time.</em></span>
    </p><p>
      If someone feels they have been defamed they will do the
      following:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          They should (on pain of costs penalties) carry out the
          <span class="strong"><strong>pre-action protocol</strong></span>
          requiring them to write a letter before action to the
          person/people they intend to sue.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          They will fill in a <span class="strong"><strong>claim
          form</strong></span> (old word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">writ</span>”</span>) and ask a court
          to <span class="strong"><strong>issue</strong></span> it. 
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          They are now know as the
          <span class="strong"><strong>claimant</strong></span> (old word
          <span class="strong"><strong></strong></span>
          ``<span class="strong"><strong>plaintiff</strong></span>”
          <span class="strong"><strong></strong></span> in Scotland
          ``<span class="strong"><strong>pursuer</strong></span>”) - we will call
          them <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">C</span>”</span> throughout.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Either with the claim form, or shortly afterwards, the
          claimant must also serve what is known as a
          <span class="strong"><strong>particulars of claim</strong></span> -
          which sets out the details of the claim which they are
          bringing.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          They will then <span class="strong"><strong>serve</strong></span> it
          (i.e. give it to one way or another) on one or more people who
          will then be <span class="strong"><strong>defendants</strong></span>
          (affectionately <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">D</span>”</span>)
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          The defendants will then create a document known as a defence
          which will do two things:
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem"><p>
              deal with each point in the particulars of claim saying
              whether the defendant denies it, agrees that it is true,
              or does not know;
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              sets out the defendant’s positive defences and any facts
              that the defendant relies on.
            </p></li></ol></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Many things can happen: the court will have one or more case
          management conferences or hearings to decide how the case
          should proceed and when evidence should be served; either
          party may make applications (and they usually will as we shall
          see), injunctions may be granted or discharged and so on….
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Eventually the parties will have exchanged
          <span class="strong"><strong>witness statements</strong></span> (the
          written evidence the witness is to give) and then there will
          be a
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Trial
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          After the trial if the claimant has one they may seek to
          enforce any judgment; there may be an appeal etc.
        </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="applications-and-injunctions"></a>Applications and injunctions</h3></div></div></div><p>
      In the civil procedure rules anyone can make what is known as an
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">application</span>”</span> at any time. Applications are very
      flexible. In rare circumstances:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          they can be made even before proceedings have started
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          they can be made by non-parties.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      In defamation proceedings the applications one is likely to see
      are:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          for an order to stop publication (called an
          <span class="strong"><strong>injunction</strong></span>), perhaps before
          publication has happened and even without the knowledge (at
          first) of the defendant. Such an injunction would constitute
          what is known as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">prior restraint</span>”</span> and would
          constitute a serious restriction on free speech. As a result
          the courts are very reluctant to make such orders except in
          special circumstances.
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          to find out information, particularly the identity of a

      To sue successfully for defamation C will need to prove:

          The publication of S has caused or is likely to cause

        </p></li></ol></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="serious-harm"></a>Serious harm</h3></div></div></div><p>
      The requirement of serious harm was added by the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/26/contents/enacted" target="_top">Defamation
      Act 2013</a>.<a href="#ftn.idp11214192" class="footnote" name="idp11214192"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> There has been very little consideration of what it
      means by the courts, but it is likely to make life more difficult
      for claimants.
    </p><p>
      A claimant will have to prove that their reputation either has
      suffered serious harm or that it is likely to do so. There will be
      some cases where serious harm is obvious (such as alleging that
      someone is a terrorist<a href="#ftn.idp11215760" class="footnote" name="idp11215760"><sup class="footnote">[2]</sup></a>) but in many cases the claimant will have to produce
      some evidence of harm to their reputation or risk having the claim
      dismissed at an early stage.
    </p><p>
      In the first case to consider what <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">serious harm</span>”</span>
      meant,<a href="#ftn.idp11218368" class="footnote" name="idp11218368"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a> the defendant newspaper had published an apology for
      their defamatory article. The judge decided that meant that there
      was unlikely to be any risk of future harm – because anyone
      searching the internet for the article would almost certainly find
      the apology – and since there was no proof that any harm had been
      suffered, the claim was dismissed.
    </p><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Cooke</em></span> established that the time at which to
      test whether serious harm had taken place (or was likely to take
      place) was probably the date of issue (i.e. when the claim was
      started) rather than before. This seems to mean that a newspaper
      that is threatened with a libel claim can quickly apologies and
      avoid paying damages, although they may have to pay the claimant’s
      costs of putting together their complaint.
    </p><p>
      It is far from clear exactly what you would need to do in order to
      prove serious harm.

      For a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">body that trades for profit</span>”</span>, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">serious

      The courts have made a number of efforts to define what it is for
      a statement to be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">defamatory</span>”</span>. In
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2010/1414.html" target="_top"><span class="emphasis"><em>Thornton
      v Telegraph Media Group</em></span></a><a href="#ftn.idp11227392" class="footnote" name="idp11227392"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a>, the judge listed 9 well-known examples, including
    </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
        ... words [that] tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation
        of right-thinking members of society generally?<a href="#ftn.idp11228928" class="footnote" name="idp11228928"><sup class="footnote">[6]</sup></a>
      </p></blockquote></div><p>
      That expression would seem to apply only where the claimant has
      done something wrong. Surely <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">right-thinking members of
      society</span>”</span> ought not to treat someone less well because of
      something that was not their moral fault. However, the courts have
      held that defamation does include statements that carry no moral
      criticism, for example that they have a disease.
    </p><p>
      For example in <span class="emphasis"><em>Youssoupoff v Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
      Pictures</em></span> (1934) 50 TLR 581 the court held that an
      allegation that someone had been raped was defamatory. To some
      extent this may reflect prevailing social attitudes in the 1930’s.
      The court held that a statement is also defamatory if it
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tends to make the plaintiff be shunned and avoided and that
      without any moral discredit on [the plaintiff’s] part</span>”</span>,
      which would include an allegation that they were insane or had an
      infectious disease.
    </p><p>
      In some cases, a statement that held someone up to
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">contempt, scorn or ridicule</span>”</span> has been accepted as
      defamatory. In <span class="emphasis"><em>Berkhoff v Birchill</em></span>, Stephen
      Berkhoff sued Julie Birchill for implying that he was
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hideously ugly</span>”</span> in a ridicule alone might be
      defamatory
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          likely effect of the words (not the actual effect)
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          on <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">right thinking persons generally</span>”</span> – see Byrne
          v Deane for an example of something that was not defamatory
          because it claimed someone had acted lawfully.

      A useful exercise is to think through the following imputations

        The word <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">innuendo</span>”</span> is used in two ways by
        defamation lawyers. The first in a non-technical sense to mean
        an inferred or implied meaning into words, the second is the
        label attached to a special kind of meaning that can be pleaded
        by a claimant. To distinguish it from the normal use of the word
        it is often called the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">true</span>”</span> or
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">legal</span>”</span> innuendo meaning.
      </p><p>
        A legal innuendo is a meaning that a statement possesses because
        of the knowledge of additional facts that are not general
        knowledge. It may be that only some people to whom the statement
        is published are aware of those additional facts (and the
        claimant will have to prove it). That additional knowledge can
        make something that looked innocent into a defamation and vice
        versa.
      </p><p>
        A legal innuendo gives rise to a separate cause of action. I can
        sue once on publication to the general public and another time
        on publication to those with special knowledge.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="defences"></a>Defences</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Obviously a defendant can defend themselves by denying what the
      claimant claims (eg by denying that the statement was defamatory
      or was even published). But the publication of a defamatory
      statement can be defended in certain circumstances:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          Truth – the defendant proves the imputation conveyed by the
          statement is substantially true<a href="#ftn.idp11275152" class="footnote" name="idp11275152"><sup class="footnote">[7]</sup></a>
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Privilege – otherwise known as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">absolute</span>”</span>
          privilege: the defendant proves that the statement was made on
          a privileged occasion. For example
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
              reports of a statement made in Parliament
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              contemporaneous reporting of legal proceedings
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              statements made in legal proceedings
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
              (possibly) statements made to one’s lawyer in obtaining
              legal advice (there is some doubt over this - it may just
              be a qualified privilege.
            </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Qualified privilege
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Honest opinion
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          Offer of amends
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Qualified privilege and fair comment are defeated by the claimant
      proving <span class="strong"><strong>malice</strong></span>. Like everything
      else in defamation <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">malice</span>”</span> has a peculiar technical
      meaning. Simply put it implies either that the statement was made
      for an improper motive or in the absence of honest belief in its
      truth.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="truth"></a>Truth</h3></div></div></div><p>
      It is a defence to prove that the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">imputation</span>”</span>
      conveyed by the defamatory statement is true.
    </p><p>
      At common law there was a serious limitation on this defence comes
      in the form of the <span class="strong"><strong>repetition
      rule</strong></span>. Where a defendant repeats a statement made by
      another it is not enough to prove that the statement was made, but
      that the statement was true.
    </p><p>
      For example even if the statement:
    </p><p>
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">There is a rumour that C murdered X</span>”</span>
    </p><p>
      were literally be true, the defendant would usually have to prove
      that C did murder X to defend a libel claim.
    </p><p>
      In <span class="emphasis"><em>Lewis v Daily Telegraph
      Ltd</em></span><a class="ulink" href="" target="_top">[1964] A.C. 234</a> Lord Devlin
      observed<a href="#ftn.idp11291712" class="footnote" name="idp11291712"><sup class="footnote">[8]</sup></a> that:
    </p><p>
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">… you cannot escape liability for defamation by putting the
      libel behind a prefix such as <span class="quote">‘<span class="quote">I have been told that
      …</span>’</span> or <span class="quote">‘<span class="quote">It is rumoured that …</span>’</span> and then
      asserting that it was true that you had been told or that it was
      in fact being rumoured. You have … to prove that the subject
      matter of the rumour was true.</span>”</span>
    </p><p>
      this means that:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
          adding <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">allegedly</span>”</span> after a possibly defamatory
          quote from someone else does no good at at all
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          publishing a response by the defamed person, or noting that
          something is merely someone else’s opinion is no protection.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      Sometimes a statement that implies wrongdoing by C may means
      something a little weaker than that C is actually guilty of the
      wrong. Consider:
    </p><p>
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Officers of the City of London Fraud Squad are inquiring
      into the affairs of Rubber Improvement Ltd. and its subsidiary
      companies. The investigation was requested after criticisms of the
      chairman’s statement and the accounts by a shareholder at the
      recent company meeting.</span>”</span>
    </p><p>
      What could that mean? Its direct meaning is easily justifiable
      (the Fraud Squad were investigating) but is that all? The
      Plaintiff in the case pleaded that it meant that they were guilty
      of fraud. The House of Lords decided that was going too far, but
      that it <span class="emphasis"><em>could </em></span>mean that they had so conducted
      themselves as to attract suspicion.
    </p><p>
      The courts have developed what are called the three
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Chase</em></span> levels of meaning:
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
          guilty
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          reasonable grounds for suspicion of guilt - must be based on
          the conduct of the claimant (the
          <span class="strong"><strong>conduct rule</strong></span>) and cannot be
          based merely on the fact that the police decided to
          investigate
        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
          reasonable grounds to investigate guilt
        </p></li></ol></div><p>
      What is unclear is whether the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">repetition rule</span>”</span> or
      the division of meanings into <span class="emphasis"><em>Chase</em></span> levels of
      meaning has been abolished by the Defamation Act 2013.

      The Claimant can defeat defence if they prove that D did not hold
      the opinion, except where D published someone else’s statement. In
      that case the Claimant can defeat the defence if they show that
      the defendant knew, or ought to have known, that the original
      author of the statement did not hold the opinion.

          Costs - also potentially vast since defamation cases are
