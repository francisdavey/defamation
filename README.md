Defamation
==========

This repository contains the slides and some notes to accompany [a talk on defamation](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/staying-protected-how-to-avoid-lawsuits-in-the-age-of-user-generated-content-registration-15438490942) given on 5 March 2015. At the moment the only useful files are:

* slides (in [PDF format](pdf/staying_protected/slides.pdf))
* some [notes](pages/staying_protected/index.html) (also in [PDF format](pdf/staying_protected/notes.pdf))

There is also [a video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MmCkozbCXQ&feature=youtu.be) available on youtube. The sound quality may be a little poor in places. Thank you to [mozilla](https://mozilla.org.uk/) (for hosting) and [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/) (for organising) it.

If you have any problems with these documents please raise as a git issue if possible, or send comments to me at <github-defamation@francisdavey.co.uk>

The slides and notes are written in latex.
