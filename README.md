Defamation
==========

This repository contains the slides and some notes to accompany a talk on defamation given on 5 March 2015. At the moment the only useful files are:

* slides (in [PDF format](source/slides.pdf))
* some notes (also in [PDF format](source/talk.pdf))


If you have any problems with these documents please raise as a git issue if possible, or send comments to me at <github-defamation@francisdavey.co.uk>

The slides and notes are written in latex.
